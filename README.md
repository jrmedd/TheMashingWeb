## Overview

I've decided to port The Mashing to the web. This is a slightly arduous process, as I'm not much of a Javascript programmer, and the [original version](https://github.com/jrmedd/TheMashing) is created using [Max](http://cycling74.com). My main aim here is to get better acquainted with [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). I expect the Chrome serial API has changed a hell of a lot [since I last used it](http://blog.jamesmedd.co.uk/post/63091955902/creating-subversive-little-box-2) too.
