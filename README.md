## Overview

I've loosely described The Mashing as my lover letter to and critique of button mashing games. I'll be including the game (in its own cabinet) in my [Awkward Arcade](http://awkwardarcade.co.uk).

It's now a cabinet:

## History

Originally created [by me](http://jamesmedd.co.uk) for [Digital Media Labs 2015](http://digitalmedialabs.org). It was originally built in [Max](http:/cycling74.com), and went from idea to product in about 6 days (or evenings). You can read about that process [on my blog](http://blog.jamesmedd.co.uk/post/130502764192/the-mashing).
